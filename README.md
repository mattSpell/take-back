Take Back Nashville
===============

Take Back Nashville is a crime-reporting app that allows users to create an account and see on the map where crimes have been reported as well as upload their own reports. Each icon is clickable and shows a tooltip with the date and description of the crime.

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Traceur
- Jade
- Less
- Ajax
- Bootstrap
- Google Maps API/Geocoding
- Socket.io
